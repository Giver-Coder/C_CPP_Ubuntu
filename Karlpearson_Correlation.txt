-Karlpearson Correlation Coefficient
-r = ...
-PE = ...
-Limit of correlation
-Co-efficient of Determination (Interpretation)



-Correlation is simple variance between two or more than two variables
-But, regression shows cause and effect variance

-Value of correlation lies between -1 and +1 (+ve means positive correlation(same direction change) and -ve means negative correlation(opposite direction change)
-Simple Correlation
-Multiple Correlation
-Partial Correlation




1) Do correlation and data analysis
2) Do regression using XY, X^2, Y^2, TSS, SSE, SSR, SSE, R^2. Also, do data analysis: Data Analysis->Regression->InputRange for Y and X->OutputRange
NOTE: In Data Analysis;
Regression = SSR
Residual = SSE
Total = TSS
Intercept = a
X variable1 = b
-Mostly question from regression
