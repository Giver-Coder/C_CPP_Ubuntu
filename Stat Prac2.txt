-NOTE: Print with grid
-single trial doesn't follow binomial distribution
-number of trials in binomial distribution should be finite
-bernouli trial follows binomial distribution
-Write all working expressions and calculations in paper. 
-Parameter is mean = np and variance = npq
-Mean > Variance
-binomial diostribution depend on number of trials
-trials are independent in binomial
-P(X==x) = BINOMDIST(x, n, p, TRUE)
-P(X==x) = BINOMDIST(x, n, p, FALSE)
-Expected Frequency(Fitted Frequency) = NP(X==x)
-N = Ef = Sum of frequency
-Mean = SUMPRODUCT(f, x)/SUM(f)
-BINOMDIST(x, n, p, false)
-NOTE: In excel, if parameter is like: (A2, $C$2), then A2 will be incremented and C2 will be fixed
-Expected Frequency(EF) = N*P(X==x)
-Round Expected Frequency(REF) = ROUND(EF, 0)
-P(X==3) = BINOM(3, n, p, false)
-P(X<3) = BINOM(2, n, p, true)
-P(X<=3) = BINOM(3, n, p, true)
-P(X>3) = 1 - P(X<=3)
-P(X>=3) = 1 - P(X<3)
-P(X!=3) = 1 - P(X==3)





-X is descrete random variable
-Its paramter is lamda(mean = variance)
-Poisson Distribution is independent of number of trials
-Mean  = SUMPRODUCT(f,x) /SUM(f)
